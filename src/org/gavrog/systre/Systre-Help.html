<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
The program S<small>YSTRE</small> is designed to
analyze periodic nets as they arise in the study of (extended or
non-molecular) crystal structures. The acronym stands for Symmetry,
Structure and Refinement. SYSTRE uses a method called barycentric
placement to determine the ideal (i.e., maximal embeddable) symmetry
of a crystal net and to analyze its topological structure. It then
generates a unique key for the topological type of the given net and
uses this key to look up the structure in its built-in database. Users
can also create their own databases.
</p>

<p>
S<small>YSTRE</small> also computes a refined
embedding (geometric conformation) of the given net using a method
based on simulated (physically incorrect) forces. The targeted
embedding is one that minimizes the edge length variance (normalized
to unit length) and maximizes the unit cell volume.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>

<p>
S<small>YSTRE</small> needs a Java runtime
environment (JRE) of version 1.4.2 or higher to run. The most
straightforward way to get a JRE is to download it from
java.sun.com. You might already have a useable Java installation on
your computer, though, because many programs use it.
</p>

<p>
Installing S<small>YSTRE</small> itself is very
easy. Just download the file <tt>Systre.jar</tt> and put it anywhere
you like, for example on your desktop.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>

<p>
The simplest way to start S<small>YSTRE</small> is
to double-click on its icon. If that does not work, open a console
window and type the command
</p>

<pre>
    java -jar Systre.jar
</pre>

<p>
from the same folder that you put <tt>Systre.jar</tt> in.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="file_formats">File Formats</a></h2>

<p>
Here are some examples of legal input for
S<small>YSTRE</small>. The conventional suffix for
S<small>YSTRE</small> files is <tt>.cgd</tt>. You
can cut and paste any of the following examples (or all of them) in a
<tt>.cgd</tt> file using your favorite text editor (e.g. Notepad on
Windows) and open it from S<small>YSTRE</small>.
</p>

<p>
The S<small>YSTRE</small> format allows comments,
which start with a <tt>#</tt> character and continue until the end of
the current line.
</p>

<br>
<p><b>Example 1</b>: Diamond, specified by space group, unit cell and
positions.</p>
            
<pre>
# The type of data to expect
CRYSTAL
  # Structure id (optional, NAME is equivalent to ID)
  ID    diamond
  # The space group by name

  # Atom specification: name coordination x y z
  #   (decimal numbers or fractions can be used for coordinates)
  ATOM  1  4   5/8 5/8 5/8
# This ends the structure description
END
</pre>

  # or by giving a number for one and coordinates for the other. 
  EDGE  1    0.0000  0.1416  0.2500
  # or by giving coordinates for both
  EDGE  0.0000  0.6657  0.7306    0.0000  1.1416  1.2500
  # The Keyword EDGE may be missing on consecutive lines.

<p><b>Example 4</b>: This example describes a more complicated graph
and will take S<small>YSTRE</small> significantly
longer to complete. It shows two situations in which quotes are
required.

  #     (likewise, use ":R" for rhombohedral setting, where applicable)

  ATOM
    # If the first field in a line starts with a letter, it is assumed
    # to be a keyword, so in this example, the atom names need to be quoted.

<h2><a name="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>

<p>
There are some quirks and limitations that you should be aware of when
using S<small>YSTRE</small>.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Origin choice</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
If you specify a crystal as in the second example above,
S<small>YSTRE</small> needs to compute edges based on nearest
neighbors. This does not only depend on the correct cell parameters,
but also on the origin choice. For those groups that have two
conventional choices as according to the international tables,
S<small>YSTRE</small> by default uses the second one. This can be
changed in the 'Options' dialog.
</p>

<p>
Another way to make sure that the correct origin choice is used is to
append <tt>:1</tt> or <tt>:2</tt>, respectively, to the group name as
in Example 4 above.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Rhombohedral groups</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Hexagonal versus rhombohedral settings for rhombohedral groups are
handled analogously to the above(append <tt>:H</tt> or <tt>:R</tt>,
respectively).
</p>
</dd>
