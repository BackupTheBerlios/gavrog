In process:

(empty)

Still open:

- For monoclinic structures, make beta >= 90.
- Include zeolite frameworks from Atlas.
- Give coordinates of edge centers (optional).
- Add "Next" and "Cancel" buttons for multi-structure files.
- Support more output options (e.g. CrystalMaker).
- Make available I/O formats more transparent.
- Support "Description" and "Reference" entries in .cgd and .arc files.

- Print the number of independent edge lengths (what does that mean?).
- Check for edge intersections and similar problems.
- If graph has collisions, try to refine anyway.
- Plot the quotient graph.
- Compute vertex symbols.

=====================================================

Recently done:

- Let user pick default origin choice (1st vs. 2nd). Same for hexagonal vs. rhombohedral.
- Pop up a message box in case of an exception.
- Use node coordinates closest to origin (and positive). Solve tie by x < y < z.
- Have all edges starting from one of the vertices listed.
- Phrase "Structure is new" differently.
- Give TD10 (weighted mean of cumulative cs numbers starting from 1).
