(none)

=====================================================

Open bugs:

- Fix problems reading archive files as regular input.


Planned/requested features:

- Make SystreGUI accept command line arguments.
- Make SystreGUI options available for SystreCmdline.
- Introduce keyboard shortcuts.
- Optionally report alternate monoclinic settings if better than first setting.
- Link to online databases.
- Support more output options (e.g. CrystalMaker).
- If net is not connected, process components individually.
- Check for edge intersections and similar problems.
- If graph has collisions, try to refine anyway.
- Plot the quotient graph.
- Compute vertex symbols.

=====================================================

CHANGELOG:

Systre 1.1:

- File name extensions are now case insensitive (so ".CGD" works like ".cgd").
- Unit cell volume is now reported.
- Relaxation step limit (per phase) can now be set in options dialog.
- Error conditions, such as OutOfMemoryError, are now caught by the GUI version.
- If explicit edges are given, no more are computed using nearest neighbors.
- Importance of equal edge lengths can be set numerically in options dialog.

Systre 1.0:

- Show mapping of input nodes to output nodes.
- Report coordinates of edge centers (optional).
- Implement a status bar.
- Include zeolite frameworks from Atlas.
- Add an option for processing archive files as normal input.
- Accept Delaney symbol files as input (.ds format).
- Find a better strategy for handling duplicate names or keys in archives.
- Make available input formats more transparent.
- Look ahead to see if the current input file contains more structures.
- Add "Next" button for multi-structure files.
- Support "Description" and "Reference" entries in .cgd and .arc files.
- Add option for writing complete unit cell data.
- Revise cell vectors for monoclinic and triclinic nets after cell relaxation.
- Add the "false" -z nets to the archive.
- Default origin choice (1st vs. 2nd) and H vs. R setting are now options.
- Pop up a message box in case of an exception.
- Use node coordinates closest to origin (and positive). Solve tie by x < y < z.
- Have all edges starting from one of the vertices listed.
- Phrase "Structure is new" differently.
- Give TD10 (weighted mean of cumulative cs numbers starting from 1).
