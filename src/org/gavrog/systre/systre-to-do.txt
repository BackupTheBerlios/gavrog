=====================================================

For Systre 1.0:

- Include zeolite frameworks from Atlas.
- Show mapping of input nodes to output nodes.
- Report coordinates of edge centers (optional).

For later (maybe):
- Keyboard shortcuts.
- Optionally report alternate monoclinic settings where better than first setting.
- Link to online databases.
- Support more output options (e.g. CrystalMaker).
- If net is not connected, process components individually.
- Check for edge intersections and similar problems.
- If graph has collisions, try to refine anyway.
- Plot the quotient graph.
- Compute vertex symbols.

=====================================================

Recently done:

- Add an option for processing archive files as normal input.
- Accept Delaney symbol files as input (.ds format).
- Find a better strategy for handling duplicate names or keys in archives.
- Make available input formats more transparent.
- Look ahead to see if the current input file contains more structures.
- Add "Next" button for multi-structure files.
- Support "Description" and "Reference" entries in .cgd and .arc files.
- Add option for writing complete unit cell data.
- Revise cell vectors for monoclinic and triclinic nets after cell relaxation.
- Add the "false" -z nets to the archive.
- Let user pick default origin choice (1st vs. 2nd). Same for hexagonal vs. rhombohedral.
- Pop up a message box in case of an exception.
- Use node coordinates closest to origin (and positive). Solve tie by x < y < z.
- Have all edges starting from one of the vertices listed.
- Phrase "Structure is new" differently.
- Give TD10 (weighted mean of cumulative cs numbers starting from 1).
