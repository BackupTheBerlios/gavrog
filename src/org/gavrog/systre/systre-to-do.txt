Still open:

- For monoclinic structures, make beta >= 90 (and otherwise smallest possible).

- Phrase "Structure is new" differently.

- Have all edges starting from one of the vertices listed.

- Give coordinates of edge centers.

- Use node coordinates closest to origin (and positive). Solve tie by x < y < z.

- Add "Next" and "Cancel" buttons for multi-structure files.

- Print the number of independent edge lengths (what does that mean?).

- Check for edge intersections and similar problems.

- If graph has collisions, try to refine anyway.

- Plot the quotient graph.


=====================================================

Recently done:

- Give TD10 (weighted mean of cumulative cs numbers starting from 1).
