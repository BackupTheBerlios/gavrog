Open bugs:

(none)

Planned/requested features:

- Introduce a batch mode for SystreGUI.
- Treat connectivity of '0' as yet undetermined. 
- Issue a warning if computed coordination number does not match given.
- Print parametric positions for nodes and edge centers.
- Make SystreGUI accept command line arguments.
- Introduce keyboard shortcuts.
- Link to online databases.
- Support more output options (e.g. CrystalMaker).
- Check for edge intersections and similar problems.
- If graph has collisions, try to refine anyway.
- Plot the quotient graph.
- Compute vertex symbols.
- Report induced symmetries from "given" (or report none at all) for components.
- If group has translational freedom, put one node on 0 for the respective axes.
