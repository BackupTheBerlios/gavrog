Open bugs:

- Integers starting with a '+' sign are mistakenly parsed as floating point.

Planned/requested features:

- Introduce a batch mode for SystreGUI.
- Issue a warning if computed coordination number does not match given.
- Print parametric positions for nodes and edge centers.
- Make SystreGUI accept command line arguments.
- Introduce keyboard shortcuts.
- Show alternate monoclinic settings if better than default setting.
- Link to online databases.
- Support more output options (e.g. CrystalMaker).
- Check for edge intersections and similar problems.
- If graph has collisions, try to refine anyway.
- Plot the quotient graph.
- Compute vertex symbols.
- Report induced symmetries from "given" (or report none at all) for components.
- If group has translational freedom, put one node on 0 for the respective axes.
