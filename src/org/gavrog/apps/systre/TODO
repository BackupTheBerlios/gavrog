=====================================================

Open bugs:

(none)

Planned/requested features:

- Treat connectivity of '0' as yet undetermined. 
- For polar structures, put a vertex with maximal site symmetry at origin:
	For class 1 (i.e. P1) put one vertex arbitrarily at 0,0,0.
	For class m (Pm, Pc etc) one vertex at 0,y,0.
	For classes 2, mm2, 4, 4mm, 3, 3m, 6, 6mm, one vertex at x,y,0.
- In non-stop mode, suppress alert windows.
- Make choice of output formats more self-explanatory.

- Print parametric positions for nodes and edge centers.
- Make SystreGUI accept command line arguments.
- Introduce keyboard shortcuts.
- Link to online databases.
- Support more output options (e.g. CrystalMaker).
- Check for edge intersections and similar problems.
- If graph has collisions, try to refine anyway.
- Plot the quotient graph.
- Compute vertex symbols.
- Report induced symmetries from "given" (or report none at all) for components.
