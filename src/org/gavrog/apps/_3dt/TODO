In progress:

(none)

=====================================================

Open bugs:

- Popups don't work with OpenGL on Mac Leopard (workaround exists.)
- Scene read back from file is shifted with center in upper left corner.
- Sometimes unit cells are very flat.
- Disabling and enabling of menu items is missing or clumsily implemented.

Planned/requested features:

- Better handling of size changes for the output part of the controls window.
- Capture diagnostic output in a widget like in Systre.
- Draw the skeleton.
- Save function for analysis results like transitivity, space group, etc.
- More display list generators.
- Options to change defaults for group setting on input (as in Systre.)
- Option to keep the unit cell and coordinates used in the input.
- Implement a balance/naturalize function.
- Draw tiles and dual tiles in one image.
- Better Macintosh support (desktop shortcuts and such.)
- Support for long tiling names (multi-line or something.)
- Pick separate colors for face classes.
