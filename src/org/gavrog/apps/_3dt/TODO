=====================================================

Open bugs:

- Popups don't work with OpenGL on Mac Leopard (workaround exists.)
- Sometimes unit cells are very flat.
- Disabling and enabling of menu items is missing or clumsily implemented.
- Numbers don't match original file when derived files are constructed.

=====================================================

Planned/requested features:

- Add some kind of safeguard against memory overflows.
- Implement a balance/naturalize function.
- Allow separate colors and visibility for individual faces.
- Option to keep the unit cell and coordinates used in the input.
- Add ways to manipulate the lighting.
- Determine sequence of operations to turn given tiling into a self-dual one.
- Function to revert to default settings.
- Integration with Systre ('identify net' function /action).
- Recoloring and changing size of individual and kinds of vertices.

- More display list generators.
- Options to change defaults for group setting on input (as in Systre.)
- Draw tiles and dual tiles in one image.
- Better Macintosh support (desktop shortcuts and such.)

- Draw polyhedra.
- Undo/Redo.
- Relax face shapes to approximate minimal surfaces.
- Add transparency.
