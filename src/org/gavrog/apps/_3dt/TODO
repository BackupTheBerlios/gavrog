=====================================================

Open bugs:

- Popups don't work with OpenGL on Mac Leopard (workaround exists.)
- Sometimes unit cells are very flat.
- Disabling and enabling of menu items is missing or clumsily implemented.

=====================================================

Planned/requested features:

- Implement a balance/naturalize function.
- Allow separate colors and visibility for individual faces.
- Option to keep the unit cell and coordinates used in the input.
- Add ways to manipulate the lighting.
- Determine sequence of operations to turn given tiling into a self-dual one.
- Function to revert to default settings.

- Save function for analysis results like transitivity, space group, etc.
- More display list generators.
- Options to change defaults for group setting on input (as in Systre.)
- Draw tiles and dual tiles in one image.
- Better Macintosh support (desktop shortcuts and such.)

- Draw polyhedra.
- Undo/Redo.
- Rotate by fixed amounts about fixed axes.
- Rotate along the screen normal.
- Relax face shapes to approximate minimal surfaces.
- Add transparency.
